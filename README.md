# Discrete Unit Disk Covering (2D)
A heuristic algorithm for Discrete Unit Disk Covering (DUDC) problem.
The DUDC problem focuses that using the minimal number of unit disks to cover all the given points on the plane. Mathematically, given a set <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathfrak{P} = \{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n\} " /> of n points, and a set <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathfrak{D} = \{d_1,d_2,\dots,d_m\} " /> of m disks in the plane, we want to minimize the disk number m while assuring all the points are covered by a least one disk.
